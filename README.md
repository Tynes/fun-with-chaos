# Playing with Chaos!

Chaos can be fun. A simple application that lets you experience different types of fractals and chaos.

Many systems in the world are non-linear and chaotic.  A deeper understanding of fractals could give insight into many other problems. They also can be interesting to look at! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
